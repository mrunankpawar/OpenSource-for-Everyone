## Importance of discussions on GitHub

- With GitHub discussions, the community for your project can create and participate in conversations within the project's repository.
- Discussions empower a project's maintainers, contributors, and visitors to gather and accomplish the following goals in a central location, without third-party tools.
- Share announcements and information, gather feedback, plan, and make decisions
- Ask questions, discuss and answer the questions, and mark the discussions as answered
- Anyone who visits the GitHub repository can involve in the discussion and share their thoughts or ideas to make the project better

### Best practices for GitHub Discussions:

- As a community member or maintainer, start a discussion to ask a question or discuss information that affects the community.
- Participate in a discussion to ask and answer questions, provide feedback, and engage with the project's community.
- You can spotlight discussions that contain important, useful, or exemplary conversations among members in the community.
- If an issue turns out to be a question or open-ended conversation instead of a work item to track and prioritize, you can convert the issue to a discussion.
